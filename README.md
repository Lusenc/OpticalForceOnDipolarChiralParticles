# Optical Force On The Dipoalr Chiral Nanoparticles
This project mainly record the matlab functions and lumerical scripts which include the calculation of the optical force, the visualization of vector fields, and the generation of structured light.
In detail, I collected the electric field components of the SPPs field excited by tightly focused circular polarized vortex beam. The electric field vector show interesting texture like skyrmion.

# 1. Generation of electric-type plasmonic skyrmion
## 1.1 Optical source (circularly polarized vortex beam)
## 1.2 Simulation with Lumerical FDTD

# 2. Plot the skyrmionic map in Matlab
## 2.1 Output the field data in FDTD to Matlab
## 2.2 Plot the skyrmion with 3D plot
## 2.3 Plot the skyrmion with HSL map
## 2.4 Plot the skyrmion with arrows

# 3. Richard-Wolf vector diffraction therory for the evanescent wave

# 4. Calculate Optical Force of the chiral nanoparticle
