# Optical Force On The Dipoalr Chiral Nanoparticles
This project mainly record the matlab functions and lumerical scripts which include the calculation of the optical force, the visualization of vector fields, and the generation of vortex beam.
In detail, I collected the electric field components of the SPPs field excited by tightly focused circular polarized vortex beam. The electric field vector show interesting texture like skyrmion.
